# goTask
This app is for learning and working with the Go language for a backend and React as a frontend.

# Client
This will hold the React app

# Server
This will contain the backend portions. This includes:
- REST API

## REST API
`Go` and `GraphQL`.
Work initially will be based on the tutorial here: https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin however I've used ChatGPT-4 to adjust the tutorial to use GraphQL instead of Gin. Once the tutorial is completed I will adjust the code as necessary for the task tracking app.

## Database
`MongoDB`
`BSON` format (essentially `JSON` NoSql)
